### Work, assignments and what's required of you.

The first assignment you will be given here at the MGHPCC is to take apart a NUC minicomputer to install Memory, and a Solid State drive.
Afterwards, you will have to install linux onto the NUC.
The NUC will be the computer you work on daily, you'll be using it to go through a list of different tasks, found [here.](https://github.com/mghpcc-projects/intern/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc+)

Some of these tasks include:
* Learning Vi
* Writing a bash script
* Creating a website using markdown
* Writing documentation for future interns

In addition to this, occasionally the employees will have you help them with maintenance in the server room, this could consist of replacing server components, wiring switches to different nodes, turning things off and on again, and occasionally, replacing graphics cards.
